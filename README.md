# AdventOfCode2019
 
These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2019, a series of programming puzzles that were made available during December 2019. For more info about the Advent of Code, visit https://adventofcode.com/2019/about

My main reasons for participating were learning a new programming language (Python) and of course to have fun!

Python turned out to be an easy language to learn and also quite suitable for these kind of puzzles because of the support for big numbers and being able to handle datasets with ease.

In the end I was able to solve most puzzles (maybe not all in the most optimal/pythonic way) except for day 22 part 2 (which needs some math I don't know) and day 25 part two (can only be solved after solving all other puzzles). Sure, I could google some hints, but I wanted to solve everything with the knowledge I have (except for Python of course).
